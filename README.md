## Tech Stack

**Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja

**Frontend:** HTML

**Database:** PostgreSQL

## Justification
In the backend, I chose to use Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, because of its flexibility in customization and ease in creating routes. For the database, I used the relational database postgreSQL due to its consistency to help ensure completeness of data, which is important for an inventory app. Finally, I used SQLAlchemly as the ORM to make queries in my Flask web app.

**Create inventory items**

Users will enter details for a new item, including its stock keeping unit(SKU), name, description, quantity, unit and unit cost. A dropdown with existing warehouses allows users to select which warehouse item is located.
Backend algorithms validate inputs before committing to database.

**View all inventory items**
